<h1>Testing</h1>

Below is testing conducted on the website.

<li>Initial index.html test on cloud 9, using text “Hello” after adding the initial structure (html, body, header, section, and footer). </li>
 
<h2>Testing the Booking form</h2>
<li>First I clicked the 'Invite Us to Your Local Venue' button - No request was sent as no information was filled in.</li>
<li>I filled out the form without the @ symbol for the e-mail address. As expected the form failed to submit due to incorrect formatting of the e-mail address.</li>
<li>After filling in the form I clicked the 'Invite Us to Your Local Venue' button again, this time the submission was successful. This is noted by the information appearing in the URL.</li>
 
<h2>Testing links betweens pages</h2>
For this section I tested all of the links between the pages, navigation bar and and links built into the page. Testing all of the links resulted in everything linking to another page in the website working as intended by staying within the tab.
All links to which the user is directed to another site opened in a separate browser tab. These links include social site and the third-party ticket purchasing site.
 
<h2>Issues discovered while testing and how they were rectified.</h2>
<li>While testing the videos pages the embedded videos were disappearing when testing the responsiveness of the page. There was a conflict with the class video flex display the bootstrap element. After deleting the class video the issue was resolved. </li>
<li>While testing the Music page I noticed that the audio control allowed for visitors to download the mp3. This had to be rectified as the band does not want to give music away for free. </li>
<li>For testing the responsive aspect of the website I used a Google Chrome Developer Tools</li>
<li>Validating the code was done with the help of <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea">Nu Html Checker</a> and validating of the CSS was done with the help of <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS Validation Service, Jigsaw</a></li>

This website is currently viewable with no deployment issues in:
<li>Google Chrome
<li>Safari
Cloud 9 was the editor that I used in the coding of the website.
