CREATE A WEBSITE FOR A BAND

Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. 

This website is for a local folk/trad band, The Fiddle Case, from Co. Clare. 

They have just release a new album and have a tour in 2019. The focus of the band is to communicate tour dates to their fans and sell their music.

Testing

A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:

Go to the "Contact Us" page


Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears

Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears

Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
