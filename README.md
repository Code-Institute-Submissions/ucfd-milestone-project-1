<h1>Testing</h1>

Go over all your pages and ensure they all look and work as expected
List any challenges you encountered during testing and how you solved them here. Example;

While testing the Music page, I notice that adjacent images are not properly aligned ...

Home page

While testing the Music page I noticed that the audio control allowed for visitor to download the mp3. 

A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:

Go to the "Contact Us" page


Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears

Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears

Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
